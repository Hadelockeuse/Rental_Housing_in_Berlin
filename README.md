# Rental_Housing_in_Berlin

After struggling finding a convenient flat at a reasonnable prince in Berlin, I got interested in the rental housing characterestics of that city. In this project, I first webscraped one of the famous real estate website of Berlin using Python. I then cleaned the webscraped collected data and filtered to be only left with rent offers. For instance, I filtered out every shared-flat and swap offers. Lastly, I visualized the data using Power BI.
